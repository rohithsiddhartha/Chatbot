Artisan AI - Email Warmup Overview:

Purpose of Email Warmup:

Objective: Gradually increase the volume of emails sent from a new account to establish a positive reputation with Internet Service Providers (ISPs). This improves email deliverability and reduces the chances of emails being flagged as spam.
How Email Warmup Works:

Process:
Starts with a low volume of emails sent to dummy addresses.
Gradually increases the number of emails sent each day.
This process continues to maintain mailbox health during ongoing cold outreach campaigns.
Identification of Warmup Emails:

Keyword: Warmup emails include the keyword “Artz.”
Appearance: These emails will have random subjects and may seem out of place in your sent folder.
Duration of Email Warmup:

Initial Phase: Begins with 10 emails per day, gradually increasing to a maximum of 75 emails per mailbox.
Ongoing Phase: Warmup continues to maintain the health of the email account during cold outreach.
Red Email Status:

Indication: A red status means your mailbox health is low, possibly due to early warmup stages or misconfigured DMS settings (DKIM, DMARC, SPF).
Action: If the red status persists beyond three weeks, check and adjust your email settings.



Artisan AI - Help! Ava Is Sending Strange Messages From My Email

Issue Overview:

Concern: If you see unfamiliar messages in your sent folder, don’t worry—this is part of the email warmup process.
Purpose: These emails help establish your domain's reputation, ensuring your messages don’t get filtered to spam.
Explanation:

Warmup Process: Ava sends fake interactions to dummy accounts during the warmup period. These messages are not sent to real prospects, and your account hasn’t been hacked.

Artisan AI - How to Upload a CSV File of Your Own Leads

Overview:
