Meet Ava: The AI BDR Transforming B2B Sales for Startups
Artisan is a forward-thinking start-up that emerged in 2023 in the vibrant tech hub of San Francisco. With a compact yet dynamic team of 16 members, Artisan is making waves in the AI and software development landscape. Under the strategic leadership of Group Partner Pete Koomen, Artisan is on a mission to revolutionize business processes by creating AI Employees, which they aptly call "Artisans." These Artisans are designed to replace the myriad of point solutions that businesses currently rely on, offering a consolidated, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing software platform.
The inception of Artisan was driven by a clear vision: to craft software that is not only functional but also beautiful and easy to use. This vision is particularly evident in their approach to outbound sales, where they have integrated a suite of tools into one cohesive platform. By doing so, Artisan aims to streamline the sales process, making it more efficient and less cumbersome for businesses.
What Makes Artisan’s Platform Unique?
Artisan’s platform is a game-changer in the realm of outbound sales. Unlike traditional approaches that require multiple tools and solutions, Artisan provides an all-encompassing platform that integrates every necessary tool into a single, seamless system. This includes access to extensive B2B data, AI-driven email sequences, and advanced deliverability optimization tools.
The platform’s uniqueness lies in its ability to eliminate the need for disparate tools, thereby simplifying the sales process and enhancing overall efficiency. By offering a comprehensive suite of tools within one platform, Artisan ensures that businesses can manage their outbound sales efforts more effectively, saving both time and resources. This integration not only streamlines operations but also reduces the potential for errors and inefficiencies that often arise from using multiple, unconnected tools.
Who is Ava and What Does She Do?
At the heart of Artisan’s platform is Ava, the first AI BDR (Business Development Representative) Artisan. Ava is designed to automate several critical tasks in the outbound sales process, making her an invaluable asset for businesses looking to scale their sales efforts. Here’s a closer look at what Ava can do:
Lead Discovery: Ava has access to a vast database of over 300 million B2B contacts, enabling her to discover potential leads efficiently. This extensive reach allows businesses to tap into a broader market and identify high-quality leads.
Lead Research: Ava utilizes tens of data sources to conduct thorough research on each lead. This ensures that the information gathered is accurate and comprehensive, providing a solid foundation for targeted outreach.

How Does Ava Operate Within the Platform?
Upon entering the Artisan platform, users are greeted with a 10-minute onboarding conversation with Ava. This initial interaction is designed to gather all the necessary information Ava needs to manage outbound campaigns effectively. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of how Ava operates within the platform:
Onboarding Conversation: Ava conducts a comprehensive onboarding conversation to understand the user’s business, products, and sales objectives. This conversation is crucial for Ava to tailor her approach to the specific needs of the business.
Knowledge Base Creation: Ava scrapes the user’s website and uses the information gathered during the onboarding conversation to create a detailed knowledge base. This knowledge base serves as the foundation for all subsequent email communications.
Prospecting Leads: Ava leverages a database of over 270 million contacts to prospect leads at scale. She gathers tens of data points on each lead to ensure that the information is accurate and relevant.
Email Crafting: Using the knowledge base and lead data, Ava ghostwrites thousands of tailored emails to prospects. These emails are highly personalized, incorporating information provided by the user and publicly available data about the leads.
Managing Replies: Ava handles replies from prospects with the primary objective of booking sales meetings into the user’s calendar. While this feature is currently in Beta, it showcases Ava’s potential to streamline the entire sales process. Users are required to manually review emails during the initial phase to ensure accuracy and effectiveness.
