Introduction to Ava, the AI Sales Rep

Sales representatives spend millions of hours tediously researching prospects, writing emails, and booking meetings. But what if we told you it doesn't have to be that way? Introducing Ava, the sales rep.

Artisan Ava is just like anyone else on your team. She has a unique personality and gets to know you. She has conversations with her colleagues via Slack, learns how the company works, and gets better at her job. But Ava isn't like her colleagues at all—Ava is a first-of-her-kind, cutting-edge AI agent trained to revolutionize outbound sales.

Ava is an Artisan. She prospects using her database of over 250 million contacts with 65 parameters. She crafts and sends intent-driven bespoke email sequences to thousands of prospects per month. She responds to prospect questions using her superhuman product knowledge and self-improves using advanced data analytics skills to adaptively modify her writing style, optimizing for conversions. She books meetings into her SDR colleagues' calendars and exports engaged prospects to their CRM—all with no human input. And she costs 96% less than hiring someone to do her job.

Ava marks the beginning of the next industrial revolution, and of an army of Artisans we're introducing to take productivity to new heights. This isn't magic; this is the future, and we're just getting started.
